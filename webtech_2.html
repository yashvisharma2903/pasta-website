                        <li>

                        <li>
                            Now, heat the olive oil and add the peeled (or pureed) tomatoes, basil and parsley to the pan. Mix all the ingredients well and let it simmer for 10 minutes until the sauce starts to thicken. When the sauce starts gaining consistency, put off the burner and add salt and black pepper powder to the sauce. Keep the sauce warm. Add the pasta over the warm sauce and toss carefully so that each piece is coated with the sauce.

                    The Alfredo Pasta is an Italian pasta dish made using fresh pasta, vegetables, chicken pieces combined with butter, cream and cheese. As the cheese melts, it results in a creamy, rich cheese sauce that coats the pasta. It is without a doubt one of the most delicious and simple dishes to prepare at home.

                        <li>
                            Heat a pan on medium flame and melt some butter in it. Add the chicken pieces and sauté them. Then add oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Stir the pieces and sauté for 8-10 minutes. Once the chicken is tender and cooked, transfer it to a plate and set it aside.

                        <li>
                            In the same pan, add butter again. Once it melts, add the chopped garlic and sauté it. Once it is soft, add half the flour and mix it. Then add the rest of the flour and mix it again. Add the milk little at a time and keep stirring to avoid lumps. As the sauce begins to thicken, add oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Stir well. Then add Parmesan cheese and mix until it melts.

                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <h4>Recipe</h4>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            First make the pasta. You’ll cook it according to package instructions, until pasta is al dente, then you’ll drain the pasta but reserve a little pasta water. Be careful not too overcook, since it’ll get added back to the pink sauce and soften a little further.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, add the diced onion and saute until softened. Once the onion is soft, the garlic goes in for another minute or until fragrant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The last step is adding the milk, the cream and the shredded mozzarella cheese and stirring until a thick pink sauce forms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Add the cooked pasta back into the skillet and stir until the pasta is evenly coated in the sauce. If it’s too thick, add a splash of pasta water to loosen.

                <b>Lasagna Pasta</b>
                <p>
                    It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.
                </p>
                <h4>Recipe</h4>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
                        </li>
                    </ol>
